# LINUX Unplugged TUI Challenge

Welcome to the Terminal User Interface (TUI) Challenge for LINUX Unplugged! For one week, hosts and listeners will use only terminal-based graphical applications—text-based interfaces that render basic UIs in the terminal. No modern GUI applications are allowed outside of a terminal emulator. Compete to complete daily challenges, earn points, and showcase the power of TUI tools!

## Challenge Overview

-   Duration: 7 days
    
-   Objective: Complete common computing tasks using only TUI applications. No GUI apps like Firefox, Thunderbird, or LibreOffice, except for launching a terminal emulator if needed.
    
-   Scoring: Earn points for completing challenges. Failing a challenge by using a GUI app results in losing points. Bonus points are available for creative solutions.
    
-   Submission: Share your progress via a Boost, or email with #TUIChallenge in the subject. Include brief descriptions of tools used and bonus point claims.
    
-   Leaderboard: Total your score at the end of the week. Categories like TUI Titan (highest score), Scripting Sorcerer (most bonus points), or Terminal Survivor (no penalties) add fun!
    

## Points System

-   Base Points (based on difficulty/time):
    
    -   Easy: 10 points
        
    -   Medium: 20 points
        
    -   Hard: 30 points
        
-   Bonus Points: Up to 10 points per challenge for creative solutions (e.g., scripting, obscure TUI tools, novel workflows). Hosts award based on submissions.
    
-   Penalty: Using a GUI app for a challenge deducts the challenge’s base points (e.g., -10, -20, or -30).
    
-   Total Score: Sum of points across all challenges, including bonuses, minus penalties. Negative scores are possible.
    
-   Maximum Score: 270 points (170 base + 100 bonus)
    
-   Minimum Score: -170 points (if all challenges failed)
